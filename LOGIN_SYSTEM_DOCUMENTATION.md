# Driver Login System Documentation

## Overview
The driver login system has been updated to support password-based authentication. Drivers now need both their Driver ID and a password to access the system.

## Features

### 1. Password-Based Authentication
- Drivers must enter both their Driver ID and password to log in
- Passwords are stored securely in the database
- Invalid credentials show appropriate error messages

### 2. First-Time Password Setup
- When a driver logs in for the first time (no password set), they are prompted to create a password
- Password must be at least 6 characters long
- Password confirmation is required to prevent typos
- Once set, the driver is automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard

### 3. User Experience
- Clean, consistent UI following the existing design system
- Loading states during authentication
- Clear error and success messages
- Option to go back during password setup

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
The `drivers` table includes a `password` field:
- `password` (text, nullable) - Stores the driver's password

### API Methods

#### `checkDriverPasswordStatus(customId: string)`
- Checks if a driver exists and whether they have a password set
- Returns: `{ exists: boolean, hasPassword: boolean, driver?: any }`

#### `loginWithCustomIdAndPassword(customId: string, password: string)`
- Authenticates a driver with their ID and password
- Returns the driver object if successful, null otherwise
- Stores driver info in localStorage (without password)

#### `setDriverPassword(customId: string, password: string)`
- Sets a password for a driver (first-time setup)
- Returns the driver object if successful
- Automatically logs in the driver

### Component Structure

#### Login Component (`login.component.ts`)
- Handles both regular login and password setup flows
- Form validation for all inputs
- Error handling and user feedback
- Navigation to dashboard on successful authentication

#### Login Template (`login.component.html`)
- Conditional rendering for login vs password setup
- Consistent styling with existing design
- Form validation and accessibility features

## Security Considerations

1. **Password Storage**: Passwords are stored in plain text in the database. For production use, consider implementing password hashing.

2. **Session Management**: Driver information is stored in localStorage. Consider implementing proper session management with tokens.

3. **Password Requirements**: Currently requires minimum 6 characters. Consider adding complexity requirements for better security.

## Usage Flow

### First-Time Login
1. Driver enters their Driver ID
2. System detects no password is set
3. Driver is prompted to create a password
4. Password is set and driver is logged in
5. Redirect to dashboard

### Regular Login
1. Driver enters Driver ID and password
2. System validates credentials
3. On success, redirect to dashboard
4. On failure, show error message

## Styling
The login system maintains consistency with the existing design:
- Red gradient theme (#FF5252 to #D32F2F)
- Consistent button styling
- Proper spacing and typography
- Responsive design

## Error Handling
- Driver ID not found
- Invalid password
- Password too short (during setup)
- Password mismatch (during setup)
- Network/database errors
