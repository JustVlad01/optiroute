# Cache Busting Solutions

## Problem
The client-side application was showing cached/old versions after deployments on Render.com, causing users to see outdated content for up to 30 seconds or requiring manual refreshes.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Server-Side Cache Headers**
- Added proper `Cache-Control` headers for static files
- Static assets (JS/CSS with hashes): cached for 1 year with `immutable` flag
- HTML files: `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
- API endpoints: prevented from being cached

### 2. **Client-Side Version Checking**
- Added automatic version detection in `index.html`
- Checks for new deployments every 30 seconds
- Shows user-friendly notification when new version is available
- Automatic refresh when user switches back to tab

### 3. **Build-Time Version Generation**
- Generates `version.json` during build with timestamp and git hash
- Provides accurate deployment tracking
- Used by version endpoint for cache busting

### 4. **CDN-Level Cache Prevention**
- Added `Surrogate-Control` and `CDN-Cache-Control` headers
- Prevents caching at Render.com and other CDN levels
- Enhanced security headers

### 5. **Angular Build Optimization**
- Maintained `outputHashing: "all"` for proper asset versioning
- Ensured production builds use cache-busting file names

## Usage

### For Users:
- If a new version notification appears, click "Refresh Now"
- The app will automatically check for updates when you return to the tab

### For Developers:
- Deploy normally to Render.com
- New deployments will automatically trigger update notifications
- Monitor version changes via `/api/version` endpoint

## Technical Details

### Cache Strategy:
- **Static Assets**: Long-term caching with content hashing
- **HTML Files**: Never cached
- **API Endpoints**: Never cached
- **Version Check**: Real-time with cache bypass

### Browser Compatibility:
- Works with all modern browsers
- Graceful fallback for older browsers
- No external dependencies required

## Monitoring
Check current version: `GET /api/version`
Response includes:
- `version`: Build timestamp
- `deployTime`: ISO deployment time
- `buildHash`: Git commit hash (on Render.com)
